password_generator.py is a command-line program designed to assist in creating secure passwords. Its final result will always be a string, in plain text. Passwords can also be stored to a plain text file for future use. As this program was made as an exercise for the developer, security has not been attended to. We recommend deleting or encrypting generated passwords wherever they may be stored.
